# Corporate Gibberish Generator

## Atom Package
Consider this as a replacement for conventional dummy text, "Lorem ipsum". This package help you generate random corporate gibberish which is just like "Lorem ipusm", readable but doesn't really make any sense. But better than 'Lorem ipsum', the corporate gibberishes are more impressive.

## Usage
 * <code>ctrl+tab</code> - Generate in English
 * <code>ctrl+shift+tab</code> - Generate in Burmese (Unicode)
 * <code>ctrl+shift+alt+tab</code> - Generate in Burmese (Zawgyi)
